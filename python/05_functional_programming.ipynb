    "## Functional Programming - Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Python supports functional programming through several built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional Programming Principles:**\n",
    "1. **Immutability**: Data doesn't change after creation\n",
    "2. **Pure Functions**: Functions with no side effects\n",
    "3. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments\n",
    "4. **Function Composition**: Combining simple functions to build complex ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Three: map(), filter(), reduce()\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the fundamental higher-order functions in Python functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### map() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Apply a function to every element of an iterable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(function, iterable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Takes a function and an iterable\n",
    "2. Applies the function to each element\n",
    "3. Returns a map object (iterator)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Square all numbers\n",
    "squares = map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "# Convert to uppercase\n",
    "upper_words = map(str.upper, ['hello', 'world'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative with List Comprehension:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# map approach\n",
    "squares = map(lambda x: x**2, nums)\n",
    "# List comprehension approach\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in nums]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### filter() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Filter elements from an iterable based on a condition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "filter(function, iterable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Takes a function that returns True/False and an iterable\n",
    "2. Applies the function to each element\n",
    "3. Returns only elements where the function returns True\n",
    "4. Returns a filter object (iterator)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Filter even numbers\n",
    "evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n",
    "# Filter non-empty strings\n",
    "non_empty = filter(None, ['hello', '', 'world', ''])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative with List Comprehension:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# filter approach\n",
    "evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums)\n",
    "# List comprehension approach\n",
    "evens = [x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### reduce() Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Apply a function cumulatively to reduce an iterable to a single value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Takes a function that accepts two arguments\n",
    "2. Applies the function to the first two elements\n",
    "3. Uses the result with the next element\n",
    "4. Continues until all elements are processed\n",
    "5. Returns a single value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process visualization:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, [1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "# Step 1: 1 + 2 = 3\n",
    "# Step 2: 3 + 3 = 6\n",
    "# Step 3: 6 + 4 = 10\n",
    "# Result: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Sum/product of numbers\n",
    "- Finding maximum/minimum\n",
    "- String concatenation\n",
    "- Complex aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**map() vs List Comprehension:**\n",
    "- List comprehensions are generally faster\n",
    "- map() is more memory efficient (lazy evaluation)\n",
    "- List comprehensions are more readable\n",
    "\n",
    "**filter() vs List Comprehension:**\n",
    "- Similar performance characteristics\n",
    "- List comprehensions are more Pythonic\n",
    "\n",
    "**reduce() vs Built-in Functions:**\n",
    "- Built-in functions (sum, max, min) are faster\n",
    "- reduce() is more flexible for custom operations\n",
    "- Use built-ins when available\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use map() when:**\n",
    "- You need to transform every element\n",
    "- You're working with existing functions\n",
    "- Memory efficiency is important\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use filter() when:**\n",
    "- You need to select elements based on criteria\n",
    "- You have a complex filtering function\n",
    "- Working with existing predicate functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use reduce() when:**\n",
    "- You need to aggregate values\n",
    "- Built-in functions don't meet your needs\n",
    "- You're implementing mathematical operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Programming Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prefer built-in functions** when available (sum, max, min, any, all)\n",
    "2. **Use list comprehensions** for simple transformations\n",
    "3. **Chain operations** for complex data processing\n",
    "4. **Keep functions pure** (no side effects)\n",
    "5. **Use meaningful function names** instead of complex lambdas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chaining Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Process numbers: square them, filter evens, sum them\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "result = reduce(\n",
    "    lambda a, b: a + b,\n",
    "    filter(\n",
    "        lambda x: x % 2 == 0,\n",
    "        map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
    "    )\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples from Above:\n",
    "- **map()**: Transform numbers to squares\n",
    "- **filter()**: Select even numbers from a list\n",
    "- **reduce()**: Calculate sum, product, and complex aggregations like checking if a list is sorted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modern Python Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "While map(), filter(), and reduce() are powerful, modern Python often prefers:\n",
    "- **List comprehensions** for map and filter operations\n",
    "- **Generator expressions** for memory efficiency\n",
    "- **Built-in functions** like sum(), any(), all() for common reductions\n",
    "- **Libraries like NumPy** for numerical operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice depends on readability, performance requirements, and team preferences."
